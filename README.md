# Dungeons and Dragons C#

A sample / teaching project showing some useful C# concepts while implementing a very basic DnD game.

My goal here was to write a rather simple example which uses good coding techniques
and which also demonstrates a variety of different features of C#.
Hopefully, this provides a good basis for a novice to build on.
